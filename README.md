# Kuai Note (K-Note) Development Notes

This application was produced in conjunction with reseach for an Honors Capstone Project at Southern Utah University in Spring 2023. The current version published to this repository is not considered complete by programming development standards. This project will continue to be updated toincrease reliability and additional features. 

Upon the completion of user and application testing, this README will be updated with specific instructions for use in three separeate branches: a development branch, a branch with latest complete version, and a branch containg the executable (.exe) files for Windows, Mac, and Linux machines.
